Breaking changes

* Split out the ``tsfpga/registers/`` folder into the standalone ``hdl_registers`` project
  (https://hdl-registers.com, https://github.com/hdl-registers/hdl-registers).
  This moves all python modules from the ``tsfpga.registers`` package to a new package
  called ``hdl_registers``.
  The PyPI package `tsfpga <https://pypi.org/project/tsfpga/>`__ has a dependency on
  `hdl_registers <https://pypi.org/project/hdl-registers>`__, so if you install tsfpga via pip the
  change is transparent.
  If you use tsfpga from a repo checkout, you will also need to check out the
  `hdl_registers repo <https://github.com/hdl-registers/hdl-registers>`__.
