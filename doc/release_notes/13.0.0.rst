Bug fixes

* Adapt netlist build time reporting to work with VUnit > 4.7.0 also
  (`#87 <https://github.com/tsfpga/tsfpga/issues/87>`__).

Breaking changes

* Remove ``super().__init__(**kwargs)`` call from :meth:`.BaseModule.__init__`.
  Users that depend on base class initialization must now make these calls explicitly.
  See `#112 <https://github.com/tsfpga/tsfpga/issues/112>`__ for background.
